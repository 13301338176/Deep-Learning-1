    "As we discussed in Part 1, every time you call tf.get_variable(), you need to assign the variable a new, unique name. Actually, it goes deeper than that: every tensor in the graph gets a unique name too. The name can be accessed explicitly with the .name property of tensors, operations, and variables. For the vast majority of cases, the name will be created automatically for you; for example, a constant node will have the name Const, and as you create more of them, they will become Const_1, Const_2, etc.1 You can also explicitly set the name of a node via the name= property, and the enumerative suffix will still be added automatically:"
