    * Slide: [Gradient Descent and Structure of Neural Network Cost Functions](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/slides/sgd_and_cost_structure.pdf) by Ian Goodfellow   
These slides describe how gradient descent behaves on different kinds of cost function surfaces. Intuition for the structure of the cost function can be built by examining a second-order Taylor series approximation of the cost function. This quadratic function can give rise to issues such as poor conditioning and saddle points. Visualization of neural network cost functions shows how these and some other geometric features of neural network cost functions affect the performance of gradient descent.

## <a name="Account"></a>Account:
It is necessary to have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account to share your projects. It offers 
plans for both private repositories and free accounts. Github is like the hammer in your toolbox, 
therefore,â€Šyou need to have it!

## <a name="Academic-Honor-Code"></a>Academic Honor Code:
Honesty and integrity are vital elements of the academic works. All your submitted assignments must be entirely your own (or your own group's).

We will follow the standard of Department of Mathematical Sciences approach: 
* You can get help, but you MUST acknowledge the help on the work you hand in
* Failure to acknowledge your sources is a violation of the Honor Code
*  You can talk to others about the algorithm(s) to be used to solve a homework problem; as long as you then mention their name(s) on the work you submit
* You should not use code of others or be looking at code of others when you write your own: You can talk to people but have to write your own solution/code

## <a name="Questions"></a>Questions?
I will be having office hours for this course on Sunday (09:00 AM--10:00 AM).Â If this is not convenient, email me at hhaji@sbu.ac.ir or talk to me after class.
